This is a portfolio of my research and class projects during my undergraduate years at the University of Tulsa.

Summer 2020:
Undergraduate research project wih Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge.
Estimated maximum likelihood of COVID-19 serial intervals and incubation periods. 
This involved Weibull distributions and quantile estimates.
I wrote a research recommendation report and virtual colloquium presentation to present my findings.

Spring 2021:
Courses in data mining and predictive analytics and introductory data science.
The final projects that I worked on in my class are included in this repository.
The first project was a runthrough of advanced graphics in R, specifically rich web content using D3.
The second project was predicting graduate school admissions using SVM, linear, and decision tree regressions.
Presentations were created for both of these projects.

Summer 2021:
Research Experience for Undergraduates project with Budapest Semesters in Mathematics, and Undergraduate research project with Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge.
Created vector autoregression simulation using block Cholesky matrices, LDL decomposition, and variated based on order.
A manuscript titled "Causal Vector Autoregression Enhanced with Covariance and Order" has been submitted to MDPI.
Created CNN-LSTM model to simulate trajectory prediction of a moving object, i.e. a taxi.
Files: .py files containing the keyword "var", .py files containing "cnn-lstm", turc_keras_api_tutorial.py

Fall 2021:
While studying abroad in Thailand this semester, I took a course on econometric data analysis, in which I got to learn programming in Stata.

Spring 2022:
I took an programming course in Java my senior year to gain experience and also to prepare me for my graduate program at the University of Oklahoma.
A couple of labs that I worked on during this class are included in this repository.
